# quick-start
A way to quickly start coding the projects you want to create using a systematic process. You can start by renaming the header of this README document to your project name and in the body text, describe what it is to yourself and anyone who might jump on the project.
Use this [Project Development Checklist](https://github.com/V-FOR-VEND3TTA/quick-start/blob/main/project-development-checklist.md) to get started after you are finished renaming.
